# Employee Directory


![Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue)
  

## Description

In this assignment I was given the task of creating an Employee Directory with React. In order to complete this assignment I needed to create and manage the state of the application using 'useReducer'. I needed to filter search results live, by updating the virtual dom with the current values inside of the input field. Lastly I needed to set sorting methods on the employee's age so a user could see age descending and ascending.

Please have a look at the full application deployed at the link below:
